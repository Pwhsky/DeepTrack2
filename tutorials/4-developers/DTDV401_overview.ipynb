    "## 1. What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "A module in the DeepTrack2 framework is a `.py` source code file \n",
    "containing classes and methods which implement functionalities in a _modular_ way to make maintenance and debugging easier. Inheritance is used heavily in the design pattern of DeepTrack2, and understanding the hierarchy is crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Module structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing in a module is always the documentation for the class which\n",
    "goes over things like key features, structure, examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first class in a module is typically an **abstract** class. \n",
    "\n",
    "This abstract class provides a standardized implementation of core functionality (e.g., data processing) to ensure consistent output formatting across all derived classes in the module. For instance, whether `class A` or `class B` produces the output, the resulting format remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "More specifically, [core](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/core.py) introduces the `DeepTrackNode` class which is used to represent a node in a computation graph, which when used together with the `DeepTrackDataObject` class can store data and compute new data based on its dependencies and child nodes. Inherent to these classes is utility for dependency tracking and data validation with ID and index addresses.\n",

    "- [mie](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/mie.py): Provides functions to perform Mie scattering calculations used in simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular computing coefficients for both spherical and stratified spherical harmonics, and calculating the spherical harmonics of the Mie field with an iterative method.\n",

    "- [pint_definition](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/pint_definition.py): Extends Pint's default definitions by introducing project-specific constants\n",
    "    and unit modification for flexible calculations in he context of DeepTrack2.\n",

    "\n",
    "- [units](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/units.py): Provides unit management and conversions for simulations involving voxel dimensions and scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [core](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/core.py) also forms the base class for the [features](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/features.py) module which is the biggest module in DeepTrack2 in terms of code volume, and in turn forms the base class for all other modules in the deeptrack directory, the only exceptions being [image](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/image.py) and [properties](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/properties.py). \n",

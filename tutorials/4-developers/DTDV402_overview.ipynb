    "\n",
    "A module in the DeepTrack2 framework is a `.py` source code file \n",

    "### How is a module structured?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing in a module is always the documentation for the class which\n",

    "\n",
    "The first class in a module is typically an **abstract** class. \n",
    "\n",
    "This abstract class provides a standardized implementation of core functionality (e.g., data processing) to ensure consistent output formatting across all derived classes in the module. For instance, whether `class A` or `class B` produces the output, the resulting format remains the same.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the [`DeepTrack2/deeptrack/backend/`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/) directory is the code that forms the backbone of the framework, which consists of five modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`core`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/core.py): Provides the core DeepTrack2 classes to manage and process data. The main features of the module enable the construction of computational pipelines with computation nodes, a dictionary-like data container with data validation methods, dependency tracking, and nested data storage. \n",
    "   \n",
    "- [`mie`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/mie.py): Provides functions to perform Mie scattering calculations.\n",
    "    In particular computing coefficients for both spherical and stratified spherical harmonics, and calculating the spherical harmonics of the Mie field with an iterative method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`pint_definition`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/pint_definition.py): Extends Pint's default definitions by introducing project-specific constants\n",
    "    and unit modification for flexible calculations in he context of DeepTrack2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`polynomials`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/polynomials.py): Provides a set of functions which compute Bessel and Riccati-Bessel polynomials and their derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`units`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/units.py): Provides unit management and conversions for simulations involving voxel dimensions and   scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`core`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/core.py) module is the most important module in the backbone directory, as it is the base class for the [`features`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/features.py) module which is the biggest module in DeepTrack2 in terms of code volume, and in turn forms the base class for all other modules in the [`DeepTrack2/deeptrack/`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/) directory, the only exceptions being [`image`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/image.py) and [`properties`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/properties.py). \n",

    "\n",
    "In the [`DeepTrack2/deeptrack/sources/`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/sources/) directory is the code used to provide utility classes to manage image data sources and random number generators, the modules are:\n",

    "\n",
    "- [`folder`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/sources/folder.py): Extends the [`base`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/sources/base.py) module by introducing utilities to organize sources in directories with labeling and source splitting.\n",
    "\n",

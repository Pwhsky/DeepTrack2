    "### A module\n",
    "\n",
    "A module in the DeepTrack2 framework is a `.py` source code file \n",
    "containing classes and methods which implement functionalities in a _modular_ way to make maintenance and debugging easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used in the design of modules DeepTrack2, and understanding \n",
    "which modules are lower level and which are higher level ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is a module structured?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing in a module is always the documentation for the class which\n",
    "goes over things like key features, structure, examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first class in a module is typically an **abstract** class. \n",
    "\n",
    "This abstract class provides a standardized implementation of core functionality (e.g., data processing) to ensure consistent output formatting across all derived classes in the module. For instance, whether `class A` or `class B` produces the output, the resulting format remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical module is structured like the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "- [`core`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/core.py): Provides the core DeepTrack2 classes to manage and process data.\n",
    "    The main features of the module enable the construction of computational pipelines with computation nodes, a dictionary-like data container with data validation methods, dependency tracking, and nested data storage.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- [`mie`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/mie.py): Provides functions to perform Mie scattering calculations.\n",
    "    In particular computing coefficients for both spherical and stratified spherical harmonics, and calculating the spherical harmonics of the Mie field with an iterative method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`pint_definition`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/pint_definition.py): Extends Pint's default definitions by introducing project-specific constants\n",
    "    and unit modification for flexible calculations in he context of DeepTrack2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`polynomials`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/polynomials.py): Provides a set of functions which compute Bessel and Riccati-Bessel polynomials and their derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`units`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/units.py): Provides unit management and conversions for simulations involving voxel dimensions and   scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`core`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/backend/core.py) module is the most important module in the backbone directory, as it is the base class for the [`features`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/features.py) module which is the biggest module in DeepTrack2 in terms of code volume, and in turn forms the base class for all other modules in the [`DeepTrack2/deeptrack/`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/) directory, the only exceptions being [`image`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/image.py) and [`properties`](https://github.com/DeepTrackAI/DeepTrack2/blob/develop/deeptrack/properties.py). \n"
